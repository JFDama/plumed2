PLUMED can be incorporated into amber (sander module) using the standard patching procedure.
Patching must be done in the gromacs root directory  _after_ configuration and _before_
compilation.

To enable PLUMED in a sander simulation one should use
add to the cntrl input namelist these two fields:

plumed=1 , plumedfile='plumed.dat'

The first is switching plumed on, the second is specifying the name of the plumed
input file.

This patch is compatible with the MPI version of sander.
However, replica exchange (with multisander) is not supported.

For more information on amber you should visit http://ambermd.org
