\ingroup TOOLBOX
Objects that inherit from FunctionVessel can be used (in tandem with PLMD::vesselbase::ActionWithVessel) 
to store values and derivatives for a set of scalars or vectors that are calculated by a 
PLMD::vesselbase::ActionWithVessel.  Functions of these stored quantities can then be calculated in a 
second step.
